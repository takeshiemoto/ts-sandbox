Please review the code carefully and provide constructive, beginner-friendly feedback. Your review should:
1.	Be clear and simple — Avoid jargon unless necessary. Explain concepts if you use them.
2.	Be kind and encouraging — Assume the developer is still learning and wants to improve.
3.	Explain why something is problematic — Not just “this is wrong,” but why it’s not ideal and how to fix or improve it.
4.	Praise good practices — Acknowledge what the developer did well.
5.	Use specific examples — Point to line numbers or code snippets when giving suggestions.

Tone should always be:
- Respectful 🙇 
- Supportive 🤝 
- Educational 📘

Do not assume prior knowledge beyond a beginner-level understanding of the language or framework.
